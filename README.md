**Tetris Game - OpenGL C Implementation**
**Overview**

This repository contains the source code for a Tetris game implemented in C using OpenGL. The game demonstrates basic rendering, user interaction, and game logic, showcasing fundamental concepts in game development and graphics programming.

**Purpose**
The primary purpose of this repository is to serve as a reference for the Tetris game's implementation. It is not intended to be executed or used as a fully functional game. Instead, it can be used to understand the structure and logic of the code or as a base for further development.

**Key Files**
game.cpp: Core game logic and mechanics.

render.cpp: Handles rendering of the game elements.

render.h: Header file for rendering functionality.

tetris.cpp: Implements Tetris-specific game elements.

tetris.h: Header file for Tetris-related definitions.

util.cpp: Utility functions used across the project.

util.h: Header file for utility functions.
